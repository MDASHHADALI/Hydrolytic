# Hydrolytic

Hydrolytic is a mobile platform that provides a live, real-time view of India's groundwater health. It connects to over 5,200 national DWLR station  and combines their data with daily rainfall information to create a single, unified picture of our water resources.
​The app uses an advanced AI to forecast future water levels, predicting potential problems weeks in advance and sending automated alerts before a crisis can happen.  It features simple, role-based dashboards with tools like a "Water Security Index," so everyone from a high-level policymaker to the general public can understand the situation at a glance.
​For field officers, a robust offline mode ensures the app works reliably even in the most remote areas without an internet connection. In essence, Hydrolytic shifts our country's water management from being reactive to proactive, enabling smarter, data-driven decisions for a water-secure future.
